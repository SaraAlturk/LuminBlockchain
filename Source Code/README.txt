This file provides a glimpse of how Lumin works.

1. Ethereum Setup: The Ethereum platform was set up on the local machine.
2. Download Ganache CLI: This tool connects to the local Ethereum blockchain.
3. Download MetaMask Extension: Install this for the eWallet functionality.
4. Download PyQt5: This Python package is used to run the frontend application.

Steps for Running the Program:

1. Run Ganache from the Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
2. Navigate to the Lumin folder using a different command line interface.
3. Execute the command: `truffle migrate`. This command compiles and deploys the smart contract, thus connecting it to the local blockchain network.
4. Copy the contract address provided after migration and paste it into the Python script.
5. Run the Python script to explore the program's functionalities.

Additional Step:

The use of MetaMask in this project demonstrates and verifies the successful connection between the program and the local blockchain's Ethereum balance of ETH tokens.

To Try It Out:

Add a new account to MetaMask using the private key generated for each account in the local blockchain.
