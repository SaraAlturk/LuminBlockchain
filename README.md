# Lumin
 **Lumin**  is a blockchain-based solar energy management system designed to enhance transparency and security in renewable energy management. It addresses current energy system challenges by offering a decentralized platform that aligns with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.

**Features:**

- **Decentralized Energy Management:** Lumin enables direct energy trading between users, reducing reliance on centralized systems and minimizing security risks.
- **Blockchain Transparency:** All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity, verifiability, and resistance to tampering.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Lumin provides intuitive interfaces for both managers and users, facilitating efficient management and monitoring of solar energy resources.
- **Smart Contracts:** Transactions are managed through smart contracts on the Ethereum network, ensuring automatic execution of terms and enhancing fairness and transparency.
- **Advanced Security:** Lumin ensures data integrity, non-repudiation, and user privacy, protecting against security threats.

**How It Works:**

1. **Transaction Initiation:** Users initiate transactions through the Lumin interface, either to buy or sell solar energy.
2. **Smart Contract Execution:** The transaction is executed via smart contracts on the Ethereum network, automatically enforcing the agreed terms.
3. **Transaction Recording:** The transaction is recorded on the blockchain, adding a new block to the chain.
4. **Transaction Display:** Details of the transaction are displayed on Lumin’s interface for user review and monitoring.
5. **Verification and Broadcasting:** The transaction is verified by the blockchain network and then broadcasted and confirmed.
6. **Real-Time Updates:** Data is updated and displayed to users and managers in real-time, allowing for effective monitoring and management.

**Tools Used:**

- **Ganache:** A local blockchain environment for testing and deploying smart contracts.
- **Truffle:** A development framework for Ethereum to streamline smart contract processes.
- **Solidity:** The programming language used for developing smart contracts.
- **MetaMask:** A tool for managing digital assets and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Python (PyQt5):** Used for data processing and building the user interface.
- **Ethereum:** The blockchain platform powering Lumin’s decentralized operations.

**Future Work:**

As we look to the future, we aim to expand Lumin to include additional renewable energy sources like wind and hydro. We will leverage artificial intelligence to enhance system security, implement predictive maintenance, and provide selling recommendations. Our plans also involve extending operations to new regions and forming strategic partnerships to drive innovation and contribute to global sustainability.

**Conclusion:**

Lumin is more than just a solar energy management system; it’s a comprehensive solution that leverages blockchain technology to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in renewable energy management. It is designed to support Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and promote a sustainable energy future.
